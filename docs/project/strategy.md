# **Strategy**

## Target enzymes

Proteins from the NlpC/P60 family were selected as the target for evolution; these proteins participate in cell growth, and their role is to relax peptidoglycan to allow cell growth and division. The NlpC/P60 domain is a papain-like cysteine peptidase domain approximately 100 amino acids long (Anantharaman and Aravind, 2003). These endopeptidases are involved in the cleavage of the N-acetylmuramate-L-alanine or D-γ-glutamyl-mesodiaminopimelate (Ohnishi et al., 1999). Cleavage of covalent bonds by hydrolases is required for PG growth (Typas et al., 2012). 

The selection of the NlpC/P60 peptidase family was driven by the following reasons:

* Posibility to be evolved to act as efficient peptidoglycan lysis enzymes;
* Specificity to peptodoglycan peptides;
* Small size, appealing for use in medicine and biotechnology.

We selected two putative proteins: SagA from Enterococcus faecium and LytE from Bacillus subtilis. We also decided to use the standalone Nlpc/P60 domains of SagA and LytE.

## *In vitro* evolution

The aim of our project is to evolve this protein as an effective bacteria-killing agent with the aid of a droplet microfluidics (DµF) platform; this technology allows the generation of large numbers of droplets that each act as single compartments, allowing the screening of large mutant libraries with high frequencies, resulting in a considerable reduction of the time, reaction volumes and the exploration of a larger fraction of the sequence space. This technology has already been successfully applied to evolve enzyme from several classes (Stucki et al., 2021). To this purpose, we developed a microfluidics assay based on a FRET peptide-based molecular beacon mimicking the PG linking peptide of the well-known pathogen *Staphylococcus aureus*.

## Validation

Starting protein and final product of evolution will be then used to perform *in vivo* assays to assess the activity of impairing *Staphylococcus aureus* growth in solution.
