# **In vitro evolution startegy**

##Target enzymes

Proteins from the NlpC/P60 family were selected as the target for evolution; these proteins participate in cell growth, and their role is to relax peptidoglycan to allow cell growth and division. The NlpC/P60 domain is a papain-like cysteine peptidase domain approximately 100 amino acids long (Anantharaman and Aravind, 2003). These endopeptidases are involved in the cleavage of the N-acetylmuramate-L-alanine or D-Î³-glutamyl-mesodiaminopimelate (Ohnishi et al., 1999). Cleavage of covalent bonds by hydrolases is required for PG growth (Typas et al., 2012). 

The selection of the NlpC/P60 peptidase family was driven by the following reasons:

* Posibility to be evolved to act as efficient peptidoglycan lysis enzymes;
* Specificity to peptodoglycan peptides;
* Small size is appealing for use in medicine and biotechnology.

We selected two putative proteins: SagA from Enterococcus faecium and LytE from Bacillus subtilis. We also decided to use the standalone Nlpc/P60 domains of SagA and LytE.
