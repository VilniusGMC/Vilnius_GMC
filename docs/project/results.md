## Cloning and purification

Genes were cloned in pKTCTET-0-Kan vector containing a C-terminal 6His-tag (Obexer et al., 2016). Retro-aldolase (RA) was cloned in the same vector was selected as control. Sanger sequencing relvealed that LytE gene underwent a frame-shift mutation, and construct was not used. Genes were expressed in *Escherichia coli*. Sufficient amounts of RA, SagAP60 and LytEP60 were purified, but not full length SagA.
